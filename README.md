# SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE SUMMARY

This note here will guide you on how to formulate your code, Helping you know the things to do first before building and starting up a project so you won’t end up getting stuck either by writing a spaghetti code which you will end up being stuck on the way due to improper arrangement and maintenance of code or peradventure you have an idea on what to do but don’t have the an idea on how to start with it.

**STEP-BY-STEP KEY POINTS NOTED :**
    
**About:**

Firstly, before starting a project. You will have to know about what you are building. Know exactly what is for. Know the reason for building it. If it’s one thing I know that keeps and make a software application or website a developer is building go well and smooth, it’s the developer knowing the purpose of it. And when you now get to know the purpose of it, there will be a type of imagination that comes through your mind on how this side will work, the other sides and other features. It’s just like bringing your work to life in a process of commanding and talking to your work and it response. So when given a project you have to know the about of the project. Analyze it well and know the uses , the problem it will solve. And then set a layout where you will do a step-by-step sort out on where to build first and where to do next so your code structure even not that, so you that is even building it will know the root of what you are doing and where it start so incase any confusion comes, just a step click or view of your code, you could be able to know where the issue is from.

**User Interface:**
	Secondly, after you have sorted out the about of the project, the next step is to know the structure of the user interface. If it’s one thing I always hear my boss say, it’s “(Friendly User Interface)”. You have to make the interface you are building look nice, smooth, and understandable and know that not all the clients or users who eventually uses the website or app you created will understand what is going on rather it will be complex if you overdo or don’t follow the proper procedure on how to make the user interface look nice and sensible. You must design what will make sense to the user not you doing the best design on the interface of the app and eventually hard to understand what you did and how it works. Your user interface should on it’s own ,without the user learning it, know what and how exactly this and that works, that’s what makes it friendly and make sure you use a proper and well organized UI components that matches with others e.g Buttons, Input and colors. 


**Technical Specification:**
	Thirdly, You will have to examine the project you will be working on, assuming if there is a prototype. You will have to look at it well and check to know if there are libraries needed for a side of the project work,the more used case design and the pattern on how it will be. You will also examine to know if there are third parties software you will install and use for the project. Just bring out a book and draw out or use your pc to table out the processes. You should also know the amount of data required for your project because one of the things that makes  project go fast is data internet and electricity to keep your system on and active. 

**Testing and Security:**
	Fifthly, The basic summary for this is , write clean code. When you write a clean and maintainable code and you run to test out your code. Even if there are some error or bugs there, it will be very much easier to sort out. Make sure every file code you have written, you run to test to know if the code is good to go. Also check if the security leakages and bugs are patched accurately if not delete the code and start all over.

**Deployment:**
	Sixthly,To streamline deployment, consider architectural and DevOps changes, such as adding microservices or adjusting deployment pipelines, and ensure the existence of migration scripts. Maintain multiple environments like Develop, Test, Acceptance, and Production to validate features and ensure smooth transitions. The Deployment stage is when you run your work either to the Develop stage which is commonly known as local host which developers uses to check what they are doing and how it looks if later pushed to production. They have the test stage where by the application runs in a cloud similar to the production stage where it is at a finished stage. They also have the acceptance stage which runs in the cloud as close as possible to the production environment where your application will be run to cloud to check if it is accepted without any disturbance before been pushed to the final stage of production. Atimes it uses a copy of the production database to function and deploy. Then the production stage is the actual environment where your application is set to deployed then approved for display to the cloud and browser.

**Planing:**
	Set out a time or duration on first, how much time it will take you to finish up this stage of work. And on you setting out time, you too will have to be disciplined enough not to let any distraction or compromises come. You will have to plan on what is needed. Features needed. Time to finish up this layout, what to do today , tomorrow and libraries need to accomplish this. Time it will take for you to learn a part of thing you maybe have forgotten.

 **Border Context**
 	When designing software, it's important to identify current limitations, brainstorm potential future extensions, and integrate "moonshot" ideas for innovative features to foster creativity and address unforeseen opportunities during development.
